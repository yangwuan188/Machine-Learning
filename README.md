### Assignment 2

#### Q1
* Data loading and manipulation on CIFAR-10.
* Add random noise to all training data and test data.
* Extract a subset with Cat and Dog.

#### Q2
* Study different values for PCA.
* Train these different PCA features on Naive Bayes Classifier.
* Evaluate accuracy of these classifiers on test set and plot ROC and AUC. 

#### Q3
* Train nine classifiers: four NNC, four LR, one CNN.
* Evaluate these classifers on test set, summarise the accuracy, training time and test time.
* Plot confusion matrix of these classifiers.

#### Q4
* Modify a Autoencoder architecture.
* Feed the noisy images inito the atuoencoder, calculate the reconstruction error between original images and output of autoencoder.
* Evaluate the autoencoder on test data and display the worstest 30 reconstructed images.
